# Salesforce-Ecomm-Custom-App

Once the Organisation using Salesforce had installed & configured this Salesforce Ecom App, the organisation's sales representative are able to see & shop the listed Gifts & Goodies for their respective leads as an expression of goodwill.

The Ecom App had an Backend/Admin-Panel from where various authorised vendors are able to add their respective gits & goodies with an base amount & shipping-price. To handle the Inventory & shippment process, we have developed an custome Shopify API's which interacts between the App, Backend & Shopify system whenever any gifts/goodies or orders are been placed.

We have also developed an custom Authorize-Dot-Net API's that will creates an Organisation's Profile & order payment will be charged or paid using this Authnet-Customer-Profile. Also, Authnet-echeck API was used to pay the gifts & goodies base amount to their respective vendors on weekly basis for their fulfilled orders.
